Hello, Chicago! 
It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches, in numbers this nation has never seen. By people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference. 
It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and always will be, the United States of America. 
It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long, by so many, to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve, to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day. 
It's been a long time coming; but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America. 
And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight. I know that my debt to them is beyond measure. To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters, thank you so much for all the support that you've given me. I'm grateful to them. 
I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines, and the living rooms of Concord, and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause. 
It drew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep. 
And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. 
Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, to risk their lives for us. 
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for their child's college education. 
The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we WILL get there. 
There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem. 
But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years; block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. 
What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other. 
Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers. 
In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long. 
Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. 
As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. 
And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too. 
And all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. 
To those who would tear the world down: we will defeat you. 
To those who seek peace and security. We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright, tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope. 
That's the true genius of America; that America can change. Our Union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow. 
This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election, except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old. 
She was born just a generation past slavery. A time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky, when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman, and because of the color of her skin. 
And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America. The heartache and the hope, the struggle and the progress. The times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes, we can. 
At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes, we can. 
When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes, we can. 
When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness, and a democracy was saved. Yes, we can. 
She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that "We Shall Overcome." Yes, we can. 
A man touched down on the moon. A wall came down in Berlin. A world was connected by our own science and imagination. 
And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote; because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. 
Yes, we can. 
America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves, if our children should live to see the next century, if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made? 
This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people. 
Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.

I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo, and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a thousand years, Al-Azhar has stood as a beacon of Islamic learning, and for over a century, Cairo University has been a source of Egypt's advancement. 
Together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress. 
I am grateful for your hospitality, and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. 
I am also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: assalaamu alaykum. 
We meet at a time of tension between the United States and Muslims around the world – tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. 
The relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of co-existence and cooperation, but also conflict and religious wars. 
More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. 
Moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam. 
Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of Muslims. 
The attacks of September 11th, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights. 
This has bred more fear and mistrust. 
So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. 
This cycle of suspicion and discord must end. 
I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect; and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition. Instead, they overlap, and share common principles – principles of justice and progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings. 
I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. 
No single speech can eradicate years of mistrust, nor can I answer in the time that I have all the complex questions that brought us to this point. 
But I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly the things we hold in our hearts, and that too often are said only behind closed doors. 
There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other; to learn from each other; to respect one another; and to seek common ground. 
As the Holy Koran tells us, "Be conscious of God and speak always the truth." 
That is what I will try to do – to speak the truth as best I can, humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart. 
Part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. 
I am a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. 
As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and the fall of dusk. 
As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith. 
As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam. It was Islam – at places like Al-Azhar University – that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment. 
It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed. 
Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. 
And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality. 
I know, too, that Islam has always been a part of America's story. The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco. 
In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second President John Adams wrote, "The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Muslims." 
And since our founding, American Muslims have enriched the United States. They have fought in our wars, served in government, stood for civil rights, started businesses, taught at our Universities, excelled in our sports arenas, won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the Olympic Torch. 
And when the first Muslim-American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our Founding Fathers – Thomas Jefferson – kept in his personal library. 
So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed. 
That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear. 
But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. 
The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. 
We were born out of revolution against an empire. 
We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words – within our borders, and around the world. 
We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribus unum: "Out of many, one." 
Much has been made of the fact that an African-American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President. But my personal story is not so unique. 
The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores – that includes nearly seven million American Muslims in our country today who enjoy incomes and education that are higher than average. 
Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. That is why there is a mosque in every state of our union, and over 1,200 mosques within our borders. 
That is why the U.S. government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab, and to punish those who would deny it. 
So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations – to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share. This is the hope of all humanity. 
Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task. 
Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people. These needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead; and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared, and our failure to meet them will hurt us all. 
For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere. 
When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. 
When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations. 
When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. 
And when innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. 
That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings. 
This is a difficult responsibility to embrace. For human history has often been a record of nations and tribes subjugating one another to serve their own interests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. 
Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners of it. 
Our problems must be dealt with through partnership; progress must be shared. 
We've arrived. 
Are you new here? 
This is your key. 
They eat with a knife and fork. 
How long did it take you to translate this book? 
We've seen three wars. 
That does not mean we should ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite: we must face these tensions squarely. 
And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. 
The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms. 
In Ankara, I made clear that America is not – and never will be – at war with Islam. We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security. 
Because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women, and children. And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people. 
The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to work together. 
Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban with broad international support. We did not go by choice, we went because of necessity. 
I am aware that some question or justify the events of 9/11. But let us be clear: al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. 
The victims were innocent men, women and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody. And yet Al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. 
They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with. 
Make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We seek no military bases there. 
It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women. 
It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict.

The father of a father is a grandfather, a grandfather's father is a great-grandfather, a great-grandfather's father is a great-great-grandfather, but no word has been decided upon for the generations before great-great-grandfather. 
"Aah!" she sighed. 
She is well versed in Spanish literature. 
"But don't you think that it's a little big?" asked the shopkeeper. 
Everybody loves him. 
Never say never. 
After you.

I have a week to do my homework. 
"Well," said the shopkeeper, motioning for Dima to follow her to the cash register. "That'll be 3,000,000.99, then." 
But he slept like a baby. 
A real friend is like a rare bird. 
I'll do it if they pay me.

My life had no linguistic meaning... until the day I met Saeb. 
What year were you born? 
All humans are good at heart. 
All humans buy food at the mart. 
But when I tried to turn the shower faucet, this black bubbly liquid came out. 
Can I dance here? 
"How did you fit a briefcase into your pocket?!" the woman asked, stunned. 
She baked me a cake. 
"I... actually don't know that either," Dima admitted. "Sometimes, this story really doesn't make any sense."

What do you wish for? 
Few people know anything about the plan. 
"I mean... my life," Dima said. "Anyway, there's 3,000,000 BYR in this briefcase." 
That's life. 
There's a book here. 
It's your book. 
This book was easy.

It looks like we fell into a trap. 
"But that's ridiculous!" Dima protested. "Kopeks haven't been around in ages! And 0.99 isn't even a natural number!" 
You had better go now. 
You had better go now. 
Do you speak German? 
There is no life without electricity and water. 
He was very patient. 
That party was off the hook, dude!

The holy book of Muslims is the Qur'an.

"And besides," Dima made sure to add, taking out his calculator and dividing 0.99 by 3,000,000, before multiplying by 100. "You do realize that you would only lose 0.0033%, right?" 
Tatoeba is created for adding and collecting example sentences.

"Do you know the country code for Lebanon?" Dima asked. 
They don't seem to be Americans. 
It looks like it'll be clearing up. 
Abu al-Husayn ibn al-Rawandi, already in the ninth century, held that reason is man's exclusive guide to truth, a quest in which revelation is of no help. 
According to the "ahl al-haqq" the universe consists of only one substance, and all what we name generations and corruptions, death and life, is a mere combination or dissolution of modes. 
It is astonishing to witness that the Iranians, onto whom the Arabs imposed Islam through military defeat, have become its most zealous followers to the point of oppressing those of Zoroastrianism, though it is the religion of their own fathers. A kind of Stockholm syndrome on the national scale. 
I understand, but I cannot agree. 
Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything. 
"I believe that the code for Lebanon is 961," the shopkeeper said. 
Although Iran is nowadays known for being a stronghold of Shia Islam, most Persian Muslims were Sunni until the XVth century. 
I want to buy. 
I want to buy. 
"Thanks," Dima said as he dialed the number. 
Hi. 
After listening to an Arabic song for ten seconds, Dima finally heard a familiar voice say, "As-Salamu Alaykum!" 
He likes fishing. 
He likes fishing. 
I don't really like the mall stores. 
"Walakum-us-Salam, Al-Sayib!" Dima replied. "What are you up to these days?" 
They advised us to stay put for the time being. 
"Drinking Fanta and telling noobs to shut up," Al-Sayib replied, taking a sip of the aforementioned Fanta. "Wait, who is this?" 
I don't worry so much about my resume. 
Clear society of its evils. 
The water is not potable. 
We celebrate the Star Festival in July.

"Dima?" the man that Dima called "Al-Sayib" asked. "I don't know any Dima. Sorry. I think you've got the wrong number." 
Muslims bury their dead in graves. 
Please keep this secret. 
Where is the station? 
Where's the boss? 
Where's the boss? 
I sometimes watch TV. 
"Huh?" Dima didn't understand. "But isn't this Al-Sayib? And aren't you drinking Fanta and telling noobs to shut up?" 
These things I've told you I know from experience. 
"Yes, that's me," said Al-Sayib. "But there's at least one of us in every country. And we all like Fanta, as well as putting noobs in their place." 
"Yes, that's me," said Al-Sayib. "But there's at least one of us in every country. And we all like Fanta, as well as putting noobs in their place." 
We had to dip into our savings in order to pay the unexpected medical expenses. 
This is not a sentence. 
"I see," Dima sighed. "Sorry for the confusion, then. Enjoy your Fanta, and have a good day." 
We came into the office to find Emet and Erkin wiping the windows. 
"Well?" the impatient shopkeeper asked, once Dima had ended the call. "Is everything all set now?" 
She looked as if she hadn't eaten in days. 
For a language to be international, it does not suffice to say that it is so. 
It sounds like they're not going to leave. 
Why did you lie? 
Wikipedia is the best encyclopedia on the Internet. 
"No..." Dima sighed. "I think I called the wrong country. Let me try the other 960s." 
Once, I got lost inside a tree. 
I like English better than Math. 
Methodically, Dima tried dialing numbers from 962 to 965, but always ended up with the wrong Al-Sayib, though each liked Fanta and disliked noobs. 
The room key, please. 
My name is Ahmad.

After listening to an Arabic song for twenty seconds this time - for if he listened for ten this would be a duplicate sentence - Dima finally heard a familiar voice say, "As-Salamu Alaykum!" 
Though very outspoken, purists do not comprise the majority on Tatoeba. 
I write everything down; I feel uneasy without my notebook. 
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! 
The conference continued till 5 o'clock. 
Takada is the richest out of all of us. 
When they hear 'Japanese-style room,' most people probably think of a tatami room. 
I am not sure whether I will be able to come with you. 
Never forget to lock the door. 
As far as I know, he's an excellent student. 
"Walakum-us-Salam, Al-Sayib!" Dima replied, but raised the volume on his phone this time, so as to avoid making this a duplicate sentence. "What are you up to these days?" 
Between you and me, he has a shallow way of thinking. 
It was a mistake to refuse his assistance. 
The United Kingdom is comprised of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 
Do you want a drink? 
Come swim with me. 
"Dima?!" Al-Sayib was so shocked that he dropped his Fanta on his computer, thereby ruining his noob hunt. "Dima?! Is that really you?!" 
The Devil made me do it. 
When did you first meet him? 
Miho plays piano better than Noriko. 
The plane arrived exactly at nine. 
"Could it be...?" Dima wondered. "Did I finally get the right Al-Sayib?" 
In his essay "Esperanto: European or Asiatic language" Claude Piron has shown the similarities between Esperanto and Chinese, thereby putting to rest the notion that Esperanto is purely eurocentric. 
"Just where are you, Dima?!" Al-Sayib asked, getting a towel to wipe the spilled Fanta. 
I'm a student. 
I'm a student. 
I'm a student. 
I'm a student. 
"I'm in an Armani store buying a suit, of course," Dima replied. 
They decided to get married. 
You are not allowed to violate the rules. 
You are not allowed to violate the rules. 
You are not allowed to violate the rules. 
"What?" asked Al-Sayib. "You think that being on international TV means that you need to strut around in an Armani now?" 
My father bought me a bicycle. 
I gave my dad a tambourine as a gift. 
I just had a look at your blog— it looks interesting. 
"International TV?" Dima asked. "What are you talking about, Al-Sayib?" 
Call the doctor! 
Tatoeba: Got a PM? You're probably in trouble... 
"Your face is all over the BBC, Dima!" Al-Sayib exclaimed. "They say you slept with 25 men and then killed them! How the heck did you do that?!" 
"In one night," Dima added. 
Regardless how loud you scream "Oo-oo!", you won't turn into a wolf. 
"Even worse!" Al-Sayib exclaimed. "They don't know what to do with you, Dima!" 
Do you want to dance with me? 
Do you want to dance with me? 
My daughter has a make-believe friend. 
"What do you mean?" Dima asked, but burped, for if he remained silent, this sentence would be too simple.

She sang better than him. 
The mouse's shadow at dusk is longer than the cat's shadow at noon. 
I'm a man. 
I'm a man. 
He looked at me out of the corner of his eye. 
"LGBT communities around the world are calling you a 'hero', and say that you were framed," Al-Sayib explained. "But the law enforcement agencies are all labeling you as a ruthless murderer. Which one are you, Dima?" 
I need help. 
"I can't say I much like that choice," Dima sighed. "To be honest, my head's been all blurry ever since I woke up in a dumpster this morning..." 
"Sleeping in a dumpster, huh?" Al-Sayib asked. "That must have been a smelly experience." 
"I understand Italian perfectly," she boasted while choosing a dish from the menu, but when the food was served, it was not at all what she expected. 
I see a lion. 
I've waited for more than a week. 
"It was a big dumpster," Dima said. "And there was a lot of food, so... It wasn't exactly uncomfortable. But yes, smellier than a donkey's behind." 
"So who were the 25?" Al-Sayib asked. "Friends of yours?" 
"Do friends sleep with friends and then murder them?" Dima asked in return. 
"If they're mantises," Al-Sayib conjectured. "Then, yes." 
"To be honest," said Dima. "I really can't remember who they were..." 
"Noobs," Al-Sayib stated. "If 25 people got killed by you, Dima, then they must have been noobs." 
"Noobs?" Dima asked, a slight hint of anger in his voice. "This isn't a video game, Al-Sayib! This is real life!" 
"I know," said Al-Sayib, getting a new bottle of Fanta. "This is serious business. So why'd you call?" 
"I need some money," Dima said, with a tone of embarrassment. 
"To hire a good lawyer?" Al-Sayib asked. 
"No," Dima replied. "To help me buy this Armani. I'm dirty, remember?" 
"Oh, boy..." Al-Sayib sighed. "Well, how much do you need? I've got about 10 grand just sitting in my offshore account." 
"99 kopeks," Dima stated proudly. "I need 99 kopeks." 
"Dima..." Al-Sayib said. "That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard." 
"But it's true!" Dima insisted. "They won't let me buy the suit unless I give them another 99 kopeks! Can't you wire me some money?" 
"Dima..." Al-Sayib sighed. "How much is this phone call costing you? I bet you it's more than 99 kopeks, noob..." 
"Oh, it's a lot more," Dima smiled. "But actually, this is a collect call. So you're the noob, 'cause you're paying." 
This news made Al-Sayib so furious that he once more spilled his Fanta. 
"Dima," Al-Sayib said sternly. "You know you're like a brother from another mother to me, but... cheating an Arab is unforgivable. Goodbye!" 
And just like that, Dima's childhood friend hung up, leaving Dima - as he was before - 99 kopeks short of his goal. 
"Well..." sighed Dima, then turned to the shopkeeper and cast her a murderous glance. "I guess I have no choice now..."

There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.

No one knew it. 
Tatoeba is a language dictionary. 
You can search words, and get translations. But it's not exactly a typical dictionary. 
It's all about sentences. Not words. 
You can search sentences containing a certain word and get translations for these sentences. 
Why sentences? …you may ask. Well, because sentences are more interesting. 
Sentences bring context to the words. Sentences have personalities. They can be funny, smart, silly, insightful, touching, hurtful. 
Sentences can teach us a lot. And a lot more than just words. 
So we love sentences. But, even more, we love languages. 
And what we really want is to have many sentences in many — and any — languages. 
This is why Tatoeba is multilingual. But not that kind of multilingual. Not the kind where languages are simply being paired up together, and where some pairs are left behind. 
Tatoeba is really multilingual. All the languages are interconnected. 
If an Icelandic sentence has a translation in English, and the English sentence has a translation in Swahili, then indirectly, this will provide a Swahili translation for the Icelandic sentence. 
Languages that would have never found themselves together in a traditional system, can be connected in Tatoeba. 
But where do we get those sentences? And how do we translate them? 
Obviously, this cannot be the work of one person. This is why Tatoeba is collaborative. 
Everyone is free to contribute. 
And everyone has the ability to contribute. 
It doesn't require you to be a polyglot. 
Everyone speaks a language. 
Everyone can feed the database to illustrate new vocabulary. 
Everyone can help ensure that sentences sound correct, and are correctly spelled. 
And actually, this project needs everyone. 
Languages are not carved in stone. Languages live through all of us. 
We want to capture all the uniqueness of each language. And we as well want to capture their evolution through time. 
But you know, it would be sad to collect all these sentences, and keep them for ourselves. Because there's so much you can do with them. Which is why Tatoeba is open. Our source code is open. Our data is open. 
We're releasing all the sentences we collect under the Creative Commons Attribution license. 
This means you can reuse them freely for a textbook, for an application, for a research project, for anything! 
So that's Tatoeba. 
But that's not the whole picture. Tatoeba is not just an open, collaborative, multilingual dictionary of sentences. It's part of an ecosystem that we want to build. 
We want to bring language tools to the next level. We want to see innovation in the language learning landscape. And this cannot happen without open language resources which cannot be built without a community which cannot contribute without efficient platforms. 
So ultimately, with Tatoeba we are only building the foundations… to make the Web a better place for language learning. 
That's awesome, right? 
There's only one thing we can do now! 
The problem with many language teachers is that they underrate new technologies in their teaching methods.

Under the Tatoeba guidelines, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language and/or translate from a language they can understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier to form natural-sounding sentences in one's native language. When we write in a language other than our native language, it is very easy to produce sentences that sound strange. Please make sure you only translate the sentence if you are sure you know what it means.

You shouldn't let him go that easily. 
Stop the bus exactly at the station.

Maybe we should go to the repair shop.

Can you actually come with Jamal? 
There will be a safety lesson at the kindergarten. 
Haven't I told you it's dangerous to speed in this area?

Here's the room key. 
What are you waiting for? Let's go. 
I was a baby then. 
Did you manage to call Jamal? 
It's unusual for Jamal to go missing without saying anything. 
I could eat an elephant. 
I hope you enjoy it. 
The important thing is you're here. 
Why are you doing this, if I may ask? 
I'll never let you go. 
I don't know what you're planning to do, but I won't let you do it. 
Credit card or cash? 
Credit card or cash?

Cut it out, will you?

Can I help you, Sir? 
Do you have an appointment, Sir? 
Somebody is looking for you.

This way, Sir. 
I'm really sorry if I caused you any problems or sorrows with Mr. Sadiq.

Our clothes were always clean.

You're the sole reason of my existence. 
Living without Jamal is unthinkable. 
You have to learn from your sisters. 
We don't have any cream. 
"I'm starving." "There are some leftovers in the fridge."

Don't complain, Jamal. 
My dad is going to whip me just like a donkey.

Did you use to go out with her? 
Jamal suffered quite a lot. 
After Jamal, I don't think she has had any other boyfriend. 
Then just forget her. Leave her in peace. 
Jamal didn't say anything. 
Why don't we go outside so that we would be alone you and me? 
Why did you kick that guy out of the pizzeria?

You're the only one of the three sisters that doesn't hate me. 
Not one word, understand? 
Jamal doesn't want to know about it. 
Please understand this. 
You have to wait for one month at least. 
We have to do a blood test. 
If I'm not really pregnant, I'm going to be so disappointed. 
Not a word about this to Jamal, OK? 
If you're pregnant, you'll be able to tell him yourself. 
Did you tell Jamal? 
Please don't tell Jamal. 
Maybe I don't have a choice. 
Do you need any help, buddy? 
Do you need any help, buddy? 
Have you set the table? 
I'll help you, buddy. 
He can wait until tomorrow. 
You'd better find the courage to tell him tonight. 
I'm gonna tell Jamal tomorrow. 
That's the end of the story. 
You're getting married in three months, right? 
Give it to me, Jamal. 
Come on and tell me.

If you love me as I love you, nothing but death can part us two. 
I just cried because all the others did. 
Tom hasn't read the letter yet. 
How do you know if your email account has been hacked? 
Tom lost three million dollars last year. 
How did you come up with the idea for this exhibition? 
Why did you tell Tom it was my fault? 
That's something you need to remember.

I don't think anybody could do that. 
I wanted to buy a painting from Tom. 
I wanted to buy one of Tom's paintings. 
When I woke us this morning, I didn't want to get out of bed. 
I don't think you'll be able to do that.

Do you really think Tom will do that? 
I'm sure Tom would never do that.

You should make it. 
You have to start learning. 
You better decide if it's the place for you. 
I'll try not to be away too long. 
Can you tell me when I can have the results of the test? 
The only doctor on duty is Jamal Sadiq. 
Why don't you come to work for this clinic?
